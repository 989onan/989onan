About Me:
I have spent all of my life working on various computer game projects from Minecraft, Gmod, and to Resonite. I work on 3D modeling projects given to me by others using Blender3D.

My Projects:
- Blesonite: A Resonite into Blender3D interface via IPC connection pipes (Currently on local machine)
- [ResoniteUnityPackagesImporter](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/ResoniteUnityPackagesImporter): A package importer for Unity Package file formats made from scratch using no classes or dependencies from UnityEngine, for Resonite.
- [AvatarToolkit](https://github.com/teamneoneko/Avatar-Toolkit): A toolkit for Blender3D written in python to shorten the steps required to bring models from other games into your target platform.
- [SpaceGame2D](https://github.com/989onan/SpaceGame2D): A 2D game and game engine I am making as an experiment. Yet to come up with a name and gameplay elements.
